# Land & Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT)
2022: Calculating LBTT for first time buyers with one home. The LBTT calculator used can be found at the following site: https://www.savills.co.uk/resources-and-tools/lbtt-calculator.aspx 

## What I Learned
* **Efficiency**: Initially each tax band was hard coded into the program but this was not scalable and would have made changes to bands difficult to maintain. Instead, a text file with the text bands was used and read into the program. Therefore any changes to tax bands only have to be updating in the file. 
* More experience in writing tests
